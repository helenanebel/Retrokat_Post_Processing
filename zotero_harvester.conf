#                                                   It is -NOT- necessary that both pairs need to be specified.
#                                                   If only one pair is specified, it is used during the conversion process.
#                                                   If both pairs are specified, the online pair takes precedence over the print pair.

#
#       zotero_expected_languages           - Comma-separated list of language codes expected to be found in harvested items.
#
#                                             Some valid examples: "eng", "?eng,fre", "title+abstract:eng,ger", "?title+abstract:eng,fre", "!ger", "!ger,eng"
#
#                                             Supported languages:
#                                             afr, ara, dan, dut, ger, eng, fre, gre, ita, may, por, ron, rus, spa, srp, tur
#                                             Additional languages must be unlocked by the development before they can be used.
#
#                                             There are several modes how this setting is used, depending on whether an optional modifier is set as first character or not.
#                                             - Default (no modifier)
#                                                 - If there are multiple languages configured, the most probable language will be detected automatically.
#                                                   If there is only 1 language configured, there will be no detection.
#                                                 - The configured/detected language will be compared with the language given by Zotero.
#                                                   If they are equal, the language will be written to output.
#                                                   If not, there will be no language in the generated record. (This will most likely lead to a QA error later in the process).
#                                             - Force detection (modifier: '?')
#                                                 - Same as default, but the result of the detection will always be used, and the Zotero language will be ignored completely.
#                                             - Force languages (modifier: '!')
#                                                 - There will be no detection, the configured values will be forced.
#                                                   E.g. "!eng,fre" means that all datasets will have both languages, so be careful!
#                                             - Force language returned from the translator (modifier =)
#                                                 - There will be no detection, the language language determined in the translator will be used if it matches
#                                                   one of the language paramaters given in this parameter. Otherwise no language is set.
#                                                 - Make sure to quote the righthand side of the expression in this case to prevent clashes with ini assignment.
#                                                   (i.e. e.g. zotero_expected_languages = "=eng,fre")
#
#                                             Also, the list can optionally be prefixed with one of the following indicators regarding detection (behind the modifier):
#                                               "title"             - Use only the contents of the title field to predict the language. (default)
#                                               "abstract"          - Use only the contents of the abstract note field to predict the language.
#                                               "title+abstract"    - Use the contents of both fields to predict the language.
#
#                                             Default value: <left empty>
#
#       force_language_detection            - Force to use the result of the automatic language detection even if the translator returns a different language
#
#                                             Supported values: true, false
#
#                                             This value is deprecated, it has the same meaning as the zotero_expected_languages modifier '?'.
#                                             The setting will only have an effect if no other modifier in zotero_expected_languages is set.
#
#                                             Default value: false
#
#       zotero_review_regex                 - When either the title or keywords of a record match(es) this RegEx pattern, it will be
#                                             tagged as a review in the MARC output file.
#
#                                             Default value: <left empty>

#       zotero_update_window                - Expected time period in days between consecutive updates to the journal/new issues. Imported from
#                                             Zeder and augmented with an additional grace period. Used for alerts.
#
#                                             Default value: 0
#
#   The following fields are only applicable to the CRAWL process:
#
#       zotero_crawl_url_regex              - If specified, URLs that don't match will not be followed while crawling.
#                                             If left unspecified, all URLs will be followed for crawling.
#
#                                             Default value: <left empty>
#
#       zotero_extraction_regex             - If specificed, only those URLs that match this RegEx pattern are harvested as individual records.
#                                             If left unspecified, all URLs will be harvested.
#

#
#       zotero_max_crawl_depth              - Number of levels of links to explore during the CRAWL process.
#                                             If left unspecified, the depth is set to zero, i.e., only the links in the starting URL are processed.
#
#                                             Default value: <left empty>/0
#
# Repeatable fields:
#
#       suppress_json_field_XXX             - Used to ignore metadata fields returned by the Zotero translation server when their content
#                                             matches a RegEx pattern. The config key is suffixed with the name of the metadata field and
#                                             the value is a RegEx pattern.
#
#                                             The list of valid metadata field names can be accessed through the Zotero Scaffold tool (Help > List all fields for item type)
#
#                                             Example: suppress_json_field_pages = e[0-9]+
#
#       override_json_field_XXX             - Used to override metadata fields returned by the Zotero translation server. The config key
#                                             is suffixed with the name of the metadata field and the value is the override string. The
#                                             format specifier "%org%" can be used in the override string to insert the original value of
#                                             the metadata field. When a metadata field is suppressed and overridden at the same time, the

#       add_marc_field_XXX                  - Used to add custom MARC fields to the generated record. The config key is suffixed with
#                                             the tag and the value is the string blob of the field's contents. Field contents support

#
#                                             Inline placeholders are enclosed inside '%' characters and refer to extra data embedded as notes in
#                                             the JSON data returned by the Zotero translation server. At the time of record generation, they are
#                                             replaced with the contents of the extra data.
#
#                                             Translators must encode extra data as individual notes in the following format: <name>:<value>
#
#                                             Example: "0247 \037a%hdl%\0372hdl" where %hdl% is replaced with the contents of the extra data
#                                                                                named 'hdl'
#
#       remove_marc_field_XXX               - Used to remove MARC fields from the generated MARC record when their content matches a RegEx pattern.
#                                             The suffix 'XXX' must have the following format: <tag><subfield_code>. Removes the entire field
#                                             from the record.
#
#                                             Example: remove_marc_field_520a = ^Editorial$
#
#       rewrite_marc_field_XXX              - Used to rewrite MARC fields from the generated MARC record with the given RegEx and replacement pattern.
#                                             The suffix 'XXX' must have the following format: <tag><subfield_code>. The RegEx and replacement pattern
#                                             has the following format: Regex ||| replacement pattern. Backreferences are supported.
#
#                                             Example: rewrite_marc_field_024a = https?://doi.org/(.*) ||| \1
#
#
#       remove_marc_subfield_XXX            - Used to remove MARC subfields from the generated MARC record when their content matches a RegEx pattern.
#                                             The suffix 'XXX' must have the following format: <tag><subfield_code>. Removes all subfields with the
#                                             given subfield code matching the pattern.
#
#                                             Example: remove_marc_subfield_936a = ^\d{6}$
#
#
#       exclude_if_marc_field_XXX           - Used to exclude records from being written to the MARC output file when their content matches a RegEx
#                                             pattern.
#
#                                             The config key is suffixed with the tag whose contents are to be checked. It can optionally include a
#                                             single subfield code. The value is a RegEx pattern.
#
#                                             Example: exclude_if_marc_field_245a = (((A|a)cknowledgements)|((C|c)ontributors))
#
#       exclude_if_json_field_XXX           - Same as above but applies to metadata fields returned by the Zotero translation server.
#                                             Exclusion checks are performed at the very end of the harvesting process.
